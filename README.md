# t3adminer
Adminer for Typo3  with code changings

t3adminer is a Typo3 Extension existing in the typo3 TER. I extended it to have access to databases out of Typo3.

- Good tool together with the Extension sdb_adminer or sdb_maker. 

- This Extension is not neccessary if you have access to PHPmyAdmin instead
