# t3adminer
Adminer for Typo3  with code changings

t3adminer is a Typo3 extension existing in the typo3 <a target="_blank" href="https://extensions.typo3.org/extension/t3adminer">TER</a>. I extended it to have access to databases out of Typo3.

- Good tool together with the Extension sdb_adminer or sdb_maker. 

- This Extension is not neccessary if you have access to PHPmyAdmin instead

- installing the extension sdb_adminer enables you to add external databases!
